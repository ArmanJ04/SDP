Medicine Management System

Aim
The Medicine Management System is a Java-based application designed to demonstrate how various design patterns can be utilized to manage medication administration in a hospital environment. The primary goal of this project is to create a simplified representation of a hospital scenario where medication is prescribed, administered, and monitored.

Design Patterns
The Medicine Management System incorporates several design patterns to achieve its objectives:

1. Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern is used to define multiple medication administration strategies. In this system, we have two concrete strategies: OralMedication and InjectionMedication. This pattern allows flexibility in choosing and switching between different medication administration methods.
2. Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern is applied to the Hospital class. This ensures that there is only one instance of the hospital in the entire system. It centralizes the management of patients, doctors, nurses, and the pharmacy, making it a suitable representation of a single hospital.
3. Adapter Pattern
The Adapter Pattern is implemented using the MedicationAdapter class. This adapter adapts different medication strategies, providing a consistent interface for administering medications. It simplifies the code's structure and enables the use of various medication strategies.
4. Decorator Pattern
The Decorator Pattern is used to enhance medication strategies. The PainkillerDecorator class demonstrates how decorators can extend the functionality of medication administration. It adds a painkiller to the medication process without altering the original strategy.
5. Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern is employed for nurse notification. Nurses, represented by the Nurse class, receive real-time updates when medications are administered to patients. This pattern is crucial in healthcare environments to ensure proper patient care and monitoring.
6. Factory Pattern
The Factory Pattern is used with the MedicationFactory class to create instances of medication strategies. It encapsulates the creation logic and simplifies the process of obtaining specific medication instances.

Usage
To run the Medicine Management System:
Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
Run the Final class to observe the design patterns in action. This application simulates interactions between patients, doctors, nurses, and the pharmacy, showcasing medication prescription, administration, and nurse notifications.
